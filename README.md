# Login-Attemps-Ruby
Ruby script. Send you an email every 24h to notify you about login attemps on the unix server where it's executed

First you have to know that this is my first "usefull" ruby App,

What I plan for the future :
-Add a config.cfg
-Test on a real server
-Detect stmp server with mozilla API
-Add tls / starttls

To use this app you need Ruby env. and net/smtp (Ruby 2.0 +)
You need to puts some infos that the programm will ask and then it will send you a mail every 24h.
This App do not uses your mail infos to commercial use, if you share this app, please be sure to not send config.cfg.


Feel free to open issue or to contact me !
